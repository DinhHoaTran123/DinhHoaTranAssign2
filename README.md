I finished my project, and so it's brought to me a lot of experience. However, it's so hard, especially to get the value of Arraylist to another screen. I have to watch the recording to easy to understand
On the first screen that I created four buttons. Each button will show one restaurant.
At the top, I created three buttons 1 is my name will link to the camera, the second button will text if Pizza will connect to the website.
On the second screen will be a menu of each restaurant. I changed the picture of each restaurant.
The third screen will payment screen that make user write their information.
And last will confirm and print two array lists to screen.
And button will back to home screenstockand sachet.
